First of all sorry for the late overview of week 3. The week had been quite busy with other stuff in life and I was not able to find time to write this blog post till now. Week 3 had only some small work to be done as the project was reaching its final outcome.

The Website can be viewed [here](https://tharjun.github.io).

You can check out my proposal [here](http://bit.ly/2MFYORu). The repository that has the KDE Jekyll themed site is [here](https://invent.kde.org/arjunth/kde-connect).

I started off by improving the CSS on pages by changing from hard coded values to Bootstrap classes after the opinion from my mentor Carl Schwan. The wordings on the Get-Involved page were also updated with a lot of help from Mr.Philip from KDE Developers Telegram. Thanks a lot to him the get-involved page sounds great now.

All the missings links were also added. Since the week was busy for me, I did some more small works here and there and it got over quick.

While, I am writing this, I have also finished Week 4 and it is great and its the final outcome. Don't forget to checkout the website. So with that I conclude this post. See you in the next one. "Happy KDEing!!"
