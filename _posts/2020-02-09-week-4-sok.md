This is the overview of Week 4. This week marks the end of the SOK Project to develop KDE Connect Website. This week started of by moving the repository to the Websites Section at finally bringing it online officially at [here](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/). After the website went live more changes were suggested on the KDE Connect Developer Chats. I was happy to implement these changes as I think they were great opinions.

I am happy with the final version of the website and I am planning to contribute more to this community in the future. See you in the next Blog Post. Happy KDE'ing!!.
