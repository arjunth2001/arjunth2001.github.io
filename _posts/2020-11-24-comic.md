I illustrated a 4 part Comic as a part of my Course work for Algorithms course with my team. What is a comic without good Illustrations? Each Illustration was hand made and the illustrations saw increase in quality as the episodes progressed to match high levels of standards seen in real comics. The illustrations took a lot of effort and time and were designed with intricate details. They account for more than 100 hours of extreme work. The illustrations were made in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Procreate on iPad. Later they were put together with awesome dialogues in Adobe InDesign. The Illustrations were inspired by our favourite comics and we tried to meet their professional standards. I also designed its Website. [Visit it now](https://jekyllnvandall.github.io/). You can read the diaries on the website where we detail our contributions. Also don't forget to fill the feedback form!
